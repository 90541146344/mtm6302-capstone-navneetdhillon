Pokedex Web Application

## Project Description:
The Pokedex Capstone Project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the public [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data about Pokémon and displays them in a visually engaging gallery. The application will feature:

- A responsive design compatible with various screen sizes
- Dynamic loading of Pokémon data
- A modal or detailed view of each Pokémon with additional information
- A feature to mark Pokémon as "caught"
- "Load more" functionality to paginate through the Pokémon list

This project is an opportunity to demonstrate the culmination of skills learned in Web Development I, II, and III.
